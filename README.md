This was a coding interview I went to in 2015. I scored high on correctness, scalability and performance but low on code quality and time taken. 

What the hell is code quality anyway? Did I not have a magical easter egg surprise buried deep in my code for that VP of engineering? What is he, 8? Code quality my ass.

Anyway, I'm in a better job now. I started Segmail (https://segmail.io) and a blog here (http://webapplicationguy.com). I still order stuff from Redmart because I have a Liveup membership which comes with free delivery. 

I'm still bitter but I guess I'm better.
